At least to me if you want an honest answer...

Don't you agree that developers not unit testing their project are the worst?

This code looks like something from stackoverflow, don't tell me you copy past it?

Can you show me your app design diagrams?

Hopefully you follow XXXX standards to write your commentaries?

You are not crazy enough to ship an app without having tested it on a true device before, right? ... right??
