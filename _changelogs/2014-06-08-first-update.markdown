  1mn of silence for all the bugs reduced to dust.

The update has been submited to apple a few hours ago. Last time it took them a week before starting to review the app... Let's hope it will be faster this time. 

I am sorry for iPhone users as many bugs in the inital version are limited to them and don't affect iPad users. This phenomenom is directly linked to my lack of possesion of an iPhone.   

Whithout any further ado, let's dig into the list of improvements and corrections:

New:

- Webpages are now pre-loaded while you read an article! Switching between an article and its original webpage is much more comfortable! It improves considerably the reading experience but if you are worried about your mobile phone data consumption you can limit this feature to wifi only or even desactivate it in the settings. 

- I have added 4 new fonts to customize the display of articles: Arvo, Alegreya, Josefin-Slab and Lato. 

Fix:

- Bug preventing some webpages from loading. You might have encountered troubles specialy with destructoid.com. 

- Refine popup was not displayed properly when browsing by Website or Category. 

- On iphone the naviguation and toolbars were sometimes covered after dismissing the setting window.

- Many performance optimizations (pre-load of custom font set, formating article is now done asyncly etc etc)

Also, this update introduce ads. Nothing annoying or intrusive, you have my word. There is only one banner, nothing filthy. This is my attempt to make this app financially independent.
