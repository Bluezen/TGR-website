This update was released 6 days after being submited to apple. 

What's new in 1.0.2:

- Search feature!! You can now search in the articles text!
Some precisions on the topic:
The way the search operates is pretty basic for the moment. It simply returns articles which have every terms you entered in the search box. 
Japanese users will have to wait a bit more before using the search feature as it won't return correct results for now. Thanks for your patience.

- The app is now localized in simplified Chinese thanks to a friend of mine, Augustin!

- I have integrated Crashlytics.com to help reduce the crashes of the app.


What has been fixed in 1.0.2:

- The app is no more crashing when you try to change the settings of the Refine window while browsing by website or categories.
