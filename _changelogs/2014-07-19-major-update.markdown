1.1.1 is a major release, meaning that there is new features and noticeable modifications of the interface.

What's new:

- Introducing Newspaper-like view to browse the news. This view is set by default after the update but you can still switch to one of the two old views from the + button on the right of the "Gamer's Selection" title.

- New "Videos" category accessible from the menu. You can now watch confortably videos one after the other. 

- New lighter menu. 

- New setting to specify on which view the app must start ("Gamer's Selection", "Videos" or "Archive"). 

- The app now darkens the articles you have read. 

- UI has been cleaned globally; less buttons, pixel perfect layout & better use of colors in themes. 

Fix: 

- Rare bug with articles saved to archives not displaying every images correctly. 

- App could have crashed in some rare situation when going back from reading an article to the list of news, or going from one news to another.

What disappeared:

- The "Scroll to the top" button. I knew from the beginning that this button was redundant with the "tap on status bar" native feature from Apple but I liked to have a button at the bottom of the screen to do the exact same thing instead of having to stretch my finger to reach this narrow status bar on the top far of the screen. I took it off to lighten the interface. 

Oh and it's worth mentionning that this time Apple was faster to validate the app: it took them only 2 days! Good job!
