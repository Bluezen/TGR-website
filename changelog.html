    <p>Not much here for now as the app is not yet out on the wild (that plus the fact that I still haven't managed to make my 'Changelogs' collection work with jekyll grrr)</p>
  <ul class="posts">
    {% for changelog in site.changelogs %}
      <li><span>{{ changelog.date | date_to_string }}</span> &raquo; <a href="{{ changelog.url }}">{{ changelog.title }}</a></li>
